# Since the Gemini API is called from the client-side in this app,
# you need to replace 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY' with your actual API key in pages/index.js
# 
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# The current implementation calls the Gemini API directly from the browser.
# This means your API key is exposed in the client-side code.
#
# For production, use the secure version:
# 1. Rename pages/index-secure.js to pages/index.js
# 2. Set GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable in Vercel
# 3. The backend API route at /pages/api/generate-meal-plan.js will securely
#    handle API calls and keep your API key on the server side.
#
# Get your Gemini API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
